WARNING: cannot find kernel debuginfo : NO DWARF information: 

How to solve this?
1. If you are taking kernel from your distro like fedora, Try to install kernel-debuginfo package

2. If you are building your own custom kernel , then try the following:

2.1. make menuconfig
2.2. Important kernel configurations are :
	DEBUG_KERNEL [=y]
Location:                                                                                                                                                                                   │  
  │     -> Kernel hacking

2.3. Another important configuration is:
	CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO:
 Location:                                                                                                                                                                                   │  
  │     -> Kernel hacking                                                                                                                                                                         │  
  │       -> Compile-time checks and compiler options

2.4. Build the kernel..Thats it!!
